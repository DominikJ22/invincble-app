# Invincble-app
Welcome to my Invincible Alien tracker. You can use this app to find out a ton of information about your favoite alien characters from Invincible. This is a fun interactive app that users can play with and it has a very cool futuristic design.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and OOP.

I created this using my own knowledge and research of the show. I first made an API using OOP and creating fetch API on my main.js.
I also used a template for my CSS and HTML called lcars (based off of Star Trek) and had to adjust it to fit the criteria of my work to full connect the web application. I enjoyed the visuals of it and believe it fits the "alien tracker" look. I enjoy the front end development of this project and found out how to use JavaScript and OOP in an efficient manner. 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*
For the localhost, when you use the code for the app and invincible api, the app is functional. The only issue is on the live link it does not show the images. I could use a image hosting service to clean up this error, instead of using image links. There are also some heroku links that do not work since the site got rid of it free hosting.

## Lessons Learned:
For this application, I learned a lot on how to use and create my own JavaScript objects and formed my own API. I also learned how to effectivly create a web application that not only looks cool but also is fun to add to. I am excited to learn more on how to use OOP and different languages to make interactive applications for various databases.
